    <h3>Ultimate Skeleton</h3>
    <p><em>Ultimate Skeleton</em> is a precision platformer inspired by the classic Android game Run. You use the mouse to steer a sled that’s sliding along an array of thin and swirly platforms. I worked on this for 11 months in 2024/2025, then I put it on the shelf indefinitely because I was uncertain about the artistic direction and the scope was too big for me to make it all on my own.</p>
