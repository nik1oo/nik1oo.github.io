Nikola Stefanov, Sofia Bulgaria

I make games from scratch, and sometimes other stuff. I program C, Python, Odin, and GLSL, and I make art in Blender. I'm interested in game design, high performance computing, transport theory, formal proof, and 3D art. I'm a student at Library Genesis until one of us dies.
