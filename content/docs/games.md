## Bogwalker

![image](../../bogwalker.gif)

Logic puzzle game. It's like Minesweeper, but you can sense the mines from further away. I made this in 2 weeks. It's finished but I will refactor it at some point.

A precision platformer inspired by the classic Android game Run. Geometry is defined by signed distance fields and rendered by real-time path-tracing. Features many graphical effects such as subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, and cubemap reflections, glare, and motion blur.
