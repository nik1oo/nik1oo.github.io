_Bogwalker_ is a logic puzzle game, derivative of Minesweeper. There are crocodiles in the swamp and they are making the water around them move. The numbers show how much the water is moving. It features a beautiful water shader.

## Blade & Eye

![image](../../blade-and-eye.gif)

First-person golf-themed fantasy adventure game I made for a game jam. Iconoclastic controls. Hit watermelons to score points. It's a simple demo for a greater idea.

- Used Blender as a level editor.
