_Royal Dispute_ is a visual novel with a typing mini-game. I worked on this with a team for the span of 1 month. I was responsible for the visual novel part of the game. I made a cool animated speech bubble shader and a cool blur shader for the dialogue log background. It's a game where you play as a Destined Prince or a Demon King and get to romance a very busy princess.
