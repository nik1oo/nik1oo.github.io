[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/games/","title":"Games","section":"Docs","content":" Games # Soap Glider # A precision platformer inspired by the classic Android game Run.\nI used signed-distance fields and path-tracing for the foreground, and pre-rendered images for the background. I implemented subsurface scattering, ambient occlusion, cubemap reflections, glare, and motion blur. Might cause migranes. The Blue Break # A surfing game I made for the Chili Code Jam #3 in less than 7 days. Since then I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a massive update to improve the fidelity and apply advanced rendering techniques.\nI combined path-traced SDF geometry\u0026mdash;used for effects\u0026mdash;with rasterized triangular geometry\u0026mdash;used for rigid objects. For physics I generate SDF representation of meshes. Instead of Phong, I implemented a modified version of the EON BRDF formula, which gives much better results. Everything is multi-threaded using a custom job scheduling system. itch\nWanda # Enter-the-gungeon-inspired Bullet-hell game.\nHigh-quality ray-traced pre-rendered backgrounds. Point lights. Real geometric displacement mapping. Ray-traced reflections. Collision map generated from the geometry. Local co-op with mouse-and-keyboard versus controller. Custom SDF primitives for architectural elements. Screen-space effects: curvature-based outline, bloom, image-based glare. Skeletal animation. Bribe Artist # You have 20 seconds to draw a fake dollar, or you go to jail! Made for the 20 Second Game Jam 2024.\nRuns in the browser. Uses a hacky statistical algorithm to score your drawing. itch\nBogwalker # Logic puzzle game. It\u0026rsquo;s like Minesweeper, but you can sense the mines from further away. I made this in 2 weeks.\nRandomly-generated levels. 4 difficulty settings. A beautiful water shader. itch github\nBlade \u0026amp; Eye # First-person golf-themed fantasy adventure game I made for a game jam. Iconoclastic controls. Hit watermelons to score points. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple demo for a greater idea.\nUsed Blender as a level editor. itch\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/other/","title":"Other","section":"Docs","content":" Other # "}]
